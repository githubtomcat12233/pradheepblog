    <p>Vehicles that have two wheels and require balancing by the rider date back to the early 19th century. The first means of transport making use of two wheels arranged consecutively, and thus the archetype of the bicycle, was the German draisine dating back to 1817. The term bicycle was coined in France in the 1860s, and the descriptive title "penny farthing", used to describe an "ordinary bicycle", is a 19th-century term.</p>

    <p>Royal Enfield was a brand name under which The Enfield Cycle Company Limited of Redditch, Worcestershire[1] sold motorcycles, bicycles, lawnmowers and stationary engines which they had manufactured. Enfield Cycle Company also used the brand name "Enfield" without the "Royal".

The first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901. The Enfield Cycle Company is responsible for the design and original production of the Royal Enfield Bullet, the longest-lived motorcycle design in history.

Royal Enfield's spare parts operation was sold to Velocette in 1967, which benefitted from the arrangement for three years until their closure in early 1971. Enfield's remaining motorcycle business became part of Norton Villiers in 1967 with the business eventually closing in 1978.</p>

<p>The history of the XPulse starts with the introduction of the Hero Impulse. The Impulse was India's first adventure bike in 150cc segment. Since its inception, the bike receives a lot of appreciation from the buyers because of its amazing body but due to the low power of the bike and lack of proper marketing, the Impulse failed.[3] After the commercial failure of the Impulse, Hero MotoCorp decided to fill the void in the segment with the addition of a higher displacement ADV motorcycle named the XPulse 200. Unlike the Impulse, the new XPulse is an adventure tourer motorcycle.

Hero first unveiled the motorcycle at the 2017 EICMA Show in Italy. The XPulse 200 carries forward the legacy of the Impulse, but it is more accessible and more purposeful. The motorcycle has been updated to comply with the newest, more stringent emission norms. Upon its introduction, the XPulse 200 was praised for its good suspension and off-road ability, while some criticism was directed to the relatively low power output of the engine.[4] The motorcycle also has longer intervals between servicing and oil changes.[5]

Powering the XPulse 200 BS6 is a 199.6cc, single-cylinder engine that now features an oil-cooled setup instead of the air-cooled layout on the BS4 model. The updated motor produces 17.8bhp of power at 8,500rpm and 16.45Nm of torque at 6,500rpm. The engine is mated to a five-speed gearbox. Hero offers the XPulse 200 BS6 in a single variant with fuel-injection. The carburettor version has been discontinued.</p>

<p>The Bajaj Pulsar is a range of motorcycles manufactured by Bajaj Auto in India. It was developed by the product engineering division of Bajaj Auto in association with Tokyo R&D,[1] and later with motorcycle designer Glynn Kerr. A variant of the bike, the Pulsar 200NS was launched in 2012, but it was suspended for some time (reintroduced in early 2017 with BS IV Emission compliance and renamed the NS200).[2] With average monthly sales of around 86,000 units in 2011, Pulsar claimed a 2011 market share of 47% in its segment.[3] By April 2012, more than five million units of Pulsar were sold.[4] In 2018, they celebrated selling over ten million Pulsars backed an exclusive TV commercial and a marquee ride to in 6 cities to write "PULSAR" on a pre-defined route.

Before the introduction of the Pulsar, the Indian motorcycle market trend was towards fuel efficient, small capacity motorcycles (that formed the 80–125 cc class). Bigger motorcycles with higher capacity virtually did not exist (except for Royal Enfield Bullet with 350cc and 500cc variants). The launch and success of Hero Honda CBZ in 1999 showed that there was demand for performance bikes. Bajaj took the cue from there on and launched the Pulsar twins (150cc and 180cc) in India on 24 November 2001.[5] Since the introduction and success of Bajaj Pulsar, Indian youth began expecting high power and other features from affordable motorcycles.

The project faced internal resistance, reservations by McKinsey & Company and doubts on its effects on Bajaj's relation with Kawasaki. The project took approximately 36 months for completion and cost Bajaj ₹ 1 billion</p>
